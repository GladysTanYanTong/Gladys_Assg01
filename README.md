My website is about a study website called BigBrains that is catered towards students, mostly from Secondary School, Junior Colleges and Polytechnic students. The goals of this website is to foster collaboration and engagement and improving students' learning experience. This website offers users a colourful palatte that is easy on the eyes and easy to navigate, hopefully encouraging students to persue through their studies and be able to share their struggles with others of the same. 

DESIGN PROCESS:
As a student that has gone through Primary and Secondary School, and now in Polytechnic, I would like to have a website where I can consult with other students from different schools and levels to better my understanding of my current subjects as well as what to expect in the future. Especially in Secondary School where we had to juggle around 7 different subjects, I would have liked to have a website where people can share their notes and practice papers online for public viewing and be able to save the materials for future practise. This way, we could collectively do well in our studies. Therefore, I designed this website in hopes to have these elements to enhance students' learning journey and experience.
